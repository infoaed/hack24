participant_about_27:

I'm an online-journalist, who for the last year or so has concentrated on multimedia stories. I believe that there is lack of coherent information and that we could easily change that. One way to do that is to give journalists better tools and know-hot to tell stories that cover more than one event and explains the bigger picture. In and information-overwhelmed world, we need more in-depth storytelling and explanatory stories. And, of course, thinking in categories and mediums that is closest to our audience.

I can do descriptive statistics and visualization, frequent itemsets mining and build a model depending on the data type. Why? In order to find interesting causalities and rules, which will help to think up a solution for a certain problem.

Journalist focused on Russia for the last 10 years. As such, I saw and confronted the first wave of weaponized information that would eventually bring about the now nascent era of post-truth.

I have teamleading, teambuilding and "just come down and work" skills. I don't have my own idea but it would be great helping somebody develop his or hers. I do want to work with data, build market models, analyse data, make market research or just manage it.
